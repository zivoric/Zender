## Details
Math/scientific formula renderer using pure SCSS and custom HTML tags; JS is not used for any rendering/formatting.

API is written in TypeScript, its main functionality is for LaTeX processing and editable text (input fields).

## Completion
The rendering of formulas using SCSS and tags is mostly finished, although it may be expanded to support more symbols and formats (such as proper sigma notation).

LaTeX processing and text editing are partially completed; they are functional on at least a base level, but still are WIP and are likely very buggy and incomplete.

## Dev Preview
A preview of the current functionality is available on GitHub pages, at the following link:

*In order to enter LaTeX into the field, the `$` sign can be used, followed by the raw LaTeX input. Pressing `Enter` will then convert it into the rendered formula.*
